This example shows how clingo's asynchronous solving capabilities can be used
in a client server scenario.

To start the server, execute: 
    python server.py

Afterwards, start the client:
    clingo client.lp client-lua.lp

The client can then be controlled from the server. An overview of the available
commands is printed on the screen.
